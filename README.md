# Task Management App

## Overview
This is an example project demonstrating multi-tenant task management with **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** and **Relationship-Based Access Control (ReBAC)**. Users can:
- Sign in with Google authentication
- Create and manage organizations
- Add and manage members
- Assign and manage tasks with different permission levels

## Features
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Users can belong to multiple organizations, each with its own tasks and members.
- **Google Authentication**: Secure login via Firebase Authentication.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Changes to tasks, organizations, and memberships sync instantly via Firestore.
- **Access Control**:
  - **Org Owners (Admins)** have full control over tasks created within the organization.
  - **Task Creators** have full control over the tasks they create.
  - **Task Assignees** can view and update their assigned tasks.
  - **Org Members** have read-only access to tasks in their organization.

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/miracleonyenma/tasks-app.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   cd tasks-app
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up Firebase:
   - Create a `.env.local` file and add your Firebase credentials:
     ```env
     NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
     NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
     NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
     NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
     NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
     NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
     NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your-measurement-id
     ```
4. Run the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

## What is Relationship-Based Access Control (ReBAC)?
ReBAC is an advanced access control model that assigns permissions based on **relationships** rather than static roles. This is essential for:
- **Multi-Tenant Organizations**: Ensuring that only members of an organization can interact with its tasks.
- **Granular Permissions**: Allowing dynamic permission assignment, such as organization owners having admin rights over all tasks created within their organization.

## Why ReBAC in This App?
While RBAC ensures role-based access (e.g., "admin," "member"), ReBAC enables **contextual permissions**. For example:
- Org **owners** are automatically admins for tasks created within their organization.
- Org **members** have read-only access to tasks within their organization without needing explicit assignment.
